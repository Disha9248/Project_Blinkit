## Project Overview
This project analyzes Blinkit's operations using SQL and Power BI.It provides valuable insights into customer purchasing behavior, product demand, revenue trends, and sales performance over time and it involves data cleaning, entity-relationship modeling, SQL-based business problem-solving, table joins, views, and an interactive Power BI dashboard for deeper insights. <br><br>

## Objectives
- Identify trends in sales, customer behavior and product performance to drive business decisions.
- Analyse the reasons for product return.
- To analyse customer segments, sentiments, feedbacks.
- To analyse inventory and marketing channels.
- Clean and preprocess raw Blinkit data using SQL.
- Solve key business problems using SQL queries.
<br><br>


## Project Level: Beginner
This project is a beginners level project.To get me familiar with the basics of SQL and Power BI and to gain knowledge on how to handle real-world data analysis problems. I have worked with a small dataset and had used SQL and Power BI to solve different tasks that are commonly encountered in data analytics.<br><br>


## Dataset
The data for this project is sourced from the Kaggle dataset:
 - **Dataset Link**: [Blinkit Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/akxiit/blinkit-sales-dataset)<br><br>


## Project Workflow

#### Data Cleaning in SQL -
- Removed duplicates, handled null values, and standardized formats.
- Used SQL queries for data transformation.

#### Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) Report -
- Designed an ERD to understand data relationships.
- Business Problem Solving in SQL

#### Analyzed key performance metrics and user trends.
- Used joins, subqueries, and aggregation functions to derive insights.
- Views & Table Joins in SQL

#### Created views for easier reporting and visualization.
- Joined multiple tables for comprehensive analysis.
- Data Export to Power BI

#### Imported cleaned SQL data into Power BI.
- Power BI Dashboard (7 Pages)<br><br>
  

## Dashboard Features 

#### **Sales Performance** -<br>
- Revenue trends, order volume, and seasonal patterns.<br>
- Sales by customer segments, Products.<br>
#### **Customer Insights** -<br>
- Demographics, time period, and payment methods.<br>
- Lost and New customers.<br>
#### **Inventory Analysis** -<br>
- Stock levels and Prices.<br>
#### **Feedback Metrics** -<br>
- feedback details , feedback by sentiments, and rating analysis.<br>
#### **Marketing Analysis** -<br>
- Analyse clicks, impressions, conversions, spend.
 <br><br>
